  From now on, still the key application of drone is led drone show
  And the key points of the drone show are high accurate positioning and nice trajectory design   
     
  For accurate positioning, there are RTK GPS for big scale and outdoor drone show, motion capture system for indoor drone show
  In my case, I gonna use crazyflie2.1, the micro drone which is under 30g and 15cm size, and lighthouse positioning system
    
  Actually the positining system is not my work, cause already bitcraze have done
  Then, my work is make a nice trajectories, and usually it's very time spanding task
  I searched some stuffs and found [this](https://droneshowsoftware.com/)
  The Drone Show Software mayb the modified version of blender which is opensource 3d desing tool
